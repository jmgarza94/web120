            <h2 class="pageID">Shopping Carts</h2>
                <p>Implementing shopping cart functionality to a website is a great way to monetize on the website, and promote and help the client sell their product. Many clients will rely on their websites for income so it may be a necessity for some of our clients.</p>
                <p>One of the most important things when using a shopping cart on a website is to make sure that everything, including the shopping cart is easy for the customer to find. This means that the page needs to be laid out in a very intuitive format where the customer can easily browse any products that the client may be trying to sell from their website. If it is laid out well then the customer will be much more likely to browse and make a purchase, and the client’s revenue through their website that we build will grow. </p>
                <p>Another important feature of a shopping cart is to show the different prices of each item before tax, and the total before and after tax and shipping. The customer needs to be able to see what they are purchasing and all the prices and final cost so that they may change their order if needed; whether it’s because they have a little more money to work with or they are working with a smaller budget. This will help ensure that the website generates as much revenue as possible.</p>
                <p>One of the most important things to know when putting a shopping cart onto a website is that there are two different types that we can use; hosted shopping carts or licensed shopping carts. Bigcommerce.com states that “A third-party firm ‘hosts’ the solution and is responsible for server backups, maintenance and upgrades. The beauty of a hosted solution is that hosting comes free, which means it doesn't cost anything for the third party to keep your site functional on the Web. The main drawback with hosted solutions is that customers will be directed to another domain for payment processing”. For many people this may be the easiest form of implementing a shopping cart and they are not too worried about using another domain for the payment process, while some people and businesses may still want to do everything within their own domain. The other option, licensed shopping carts tends to have much more customization and flexibility, as well as the ability to process the transaction within their own domain, but it takes much more work and tends to be more expensive since the developer is responsible for fixing any bugs with the shopping cart feature.</p>
                <p>Shopping carts can be a huge asset to websites and should not be overlooked if the client has a product to sell. With online shopping becoming the main form of shopping nowadays, it is a very valuable skill for web developers to know.</p>
