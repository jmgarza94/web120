            <h2 class="pageID">Responsive VS Mobile Apps</h2>
            <p>When creating a website we must make sure that we make it accessible on mobile, but whether to make a responsive website or make a separate mobile application is the big debate, and both have their merits as well as their drawbacks. We are in the age of technology and things move so fast that it may be tough for some people to figure out which one suits them best, so we have to pay attention to the needs and resources of the customer and decide which one will suit those needs the best. Mobile phones are becoming more and more prevalent; the Statista Research Department states that “The number of mobile phone users in the world is expected to pass the five billion mark by 2019. In 2016, an estimated 62.9 percent of the population worldwide already owned a mobile phone (Statista)”. With this much of the earth’s population using mobile phones, it’s essential for any business to cater to those using mobile phones to view their content.</p>
            <p>There are several main key points why people tend to choose mobile-responsive websites over mobile applications, the first being that it is much faster to launch. Making a mobile website is much simpler than developing a mobile app, and for businesses looking to get their name out there as fast as they can, then a mobile responsive site is the smarter choice. Not only are mobile sites much faster to launch, but they are also a lot cheaper as well. Making a website responsive or ‘mobile-friendly’ takes a lot less work, as you only need to make media queries to get the website to function as you want it within a certain browser size, whereas a mobile application will take a lot more coding and development, which will cost more.</p>    
            <p>Mobile websites are also very easily accessible and available for anyone. Whether the user is on their own phone, laptop, tablet, or a friend’s device the website is available to them; there is no downloading or signup required, although an active internet connection is still required. The last reason for why a responsive website might be the better idea is that it is much easier for bug fixes. On websites, any issues are usually very easily fixed through a little troubleshooting in the HTML, CSS, JS, etc. while mobile application troubleshooting can be much more tedious and may take longer.</p>
            <p>While responsive websites have their merits, mobile applications do as well. Apps have much better functionality than mobile websites do. The developer can implement a very user-friendly design, shopping carts, and other features that are not included in HTML5 or would otherwise be difficult to include. One of the biggest selling points of apps is that they can work offline as well as online. Sometimes this means rendering all the necessary information before the app is even opened, or having all the information saved within the app so an active internet connection may not be necessary to use the app. This is very useful as one cannot always guarantee that they will have a constant internet connection. </p>
            <p>To sum this all up, it really depends on the needs and criteria of the customer and what kind of business they are trying to promote. While mobile applications do have more functionality and potential to larger scale businesses, it seems as though having a responsive website is a much more viable option for most businesses. It is much faster, easier, and cheaper to build and run a responsive website than it is an application.</p>
