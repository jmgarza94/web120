            <h2 class="pageID">Flexbox VS Grid</h2>
            <p>Flexbox and Grid are two newer elements in CSS that have changed how websites are being designed and developed. They have almost eliminated the need for using Float in CSS and are much more effective. Flexbox and Grid are very similar ways to layout a webpage but they each have some differences, so the developer needs to decide when and how to use each one effectively.</p>
            <p>Flexbox has only been around for a few years but it has taken the web dev community by storm. It is one of the most versatile tools for web developers and has made some aspects of web design much easier. Chris Coyier with css-tricks.com states that “Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts”. Perhaps the most common use for Flexbox is the navigation of a website. The nav tends to be too small of an element to effectively use Grid, whereas Flexbox has become the easiest way to lay out a nav, and will work responsively. It has become one of the most useful tools for making websites responsive, which is becoming more and more necessary as the prevalence of mobile devices is skyrocketing.</p>
            <p>Grid on the other hand is just as useful as Flexbox. As previously stated, it is more commonly used on a larger scale to lay out a webpage, and an be coupled with media query statements to help make a website responsive but maintain a simple and effective look no matter the device it’s being viewed on. One of the biggest differences between Grid and Flexbox is that Grid is a two-dimensional system, meaning it has both rows and columns that the developer can change, while Flexbox is typically viewed as a one-dimensional system.</p>
            <p>When using both Grid and Flexbox mixed with media queries on a website, it can greatly improve the look, style and responsiveness of the website and make it much easier to change and manage. </p>
